## Creating components in Angular

Like React and Vue, Angular is a javascript front-end framework that uses components as main building blocks. These components can be composed to create other components, this way, creating a clear separation of functionalities that are easier to maintain and grow.

```typescript
// user-profile.ts
@Component({
  selector: 'user-profile',
  template: `
    <h1>User profile</h1>
    <p>This is the user profile page</p>
  `,
  styles: `h1 { font-size: 3em; } `,
})
export class UserProfile { /* Your component code goes here */ }
```

In the decorator above we have the following properties:

* selector: defines how this component should be declared in other components;
* template: the HTML template that should be rendered. This can be substituted by `templateUrl` to pass a html file as template;
* styles: the CSS selectors available for this component. This can be substitued by `styleUrl` to pass a stylesheet (css, sass, scss) file.

## Signals and Data Binding

The function `signal` can be used in component's class to represent a state. Is similar to React's `useState`.

```typescript
export class UserLoginPage {
    clicks = signal(0);

    onClick(e: MouseEvent) {
        // mutate state
        this.clicks.set(clicks.get() + 1);

        // mutate state based on current value
        this.clicks.update((current) => current + 1);
    }
}
```

To use this state in the template you can wrap the class property in double curly braces like in the example below:

```html
<p-card>
    <p-button (onClick)="onClick($event)">
        {{ clicks() }}
    </p-button>
</p-card>
```
